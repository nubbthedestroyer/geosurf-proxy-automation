### Install

Just run there commands on a Ubuntu 16.04 server 

```bash
apt update
apt install git
git clone https://github.com/nubbthedestroyer/geosurf-proxy-automation
cd geosurf-proxy-automation
./non-docker-install.sh
```

after running these commands, you will still need to add the ip address into the Geosurf control panel here:
> https://client.geosurf.io/#!/manageips
